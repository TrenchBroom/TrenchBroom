# Note: When this variable is changed, vcpkg will need to recompile all dependencies.
# However, vcpkg will not detect the change and will happily keep using any cached
# binaries (see the lukka/run-vcpkg workflow step for details). This will cause a mismatch
# between the deployment target under which the binaries were compiled and the new
# deployment target used here. Therefore, when this variable is changed, the vcpkg binary
# cache must be invalidated. The easiest way to do that is to update vcpkg to the latest
# version because the vcpkg commit ID is part of the cache key for the binary cache.

# Note: The app bundle and the archive should be signed and notarized, otherwise macOS'
# gatekeeper will refuse to run the app. The app itself is signed as a post-build step
# using macdeployqt, and the archive is signed and notarized by the
# ./app/sign_macos_archive.sh script that is called when the build was successful. This
# script is generated from the cmake template SignMacOsBundle.cmake.in. See Build.md for
# more details on how to set up the necessary prerequisites for signing and notarizing the
# app and the archive.
