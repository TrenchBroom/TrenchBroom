		<h2>Selecting Objects</h2>
		<p>In TrenchBroom, there are three types of objects which can be selected: entities, brushes and faces. In the following sections, you will learn how you can select these objects to edit them. However, it is not possible to select any combination of objects. You can select multiple brushes and entities together because most editing operations can be applied to both these objects. Faces are a different matter though. You cannot combine faces and brushes or faces and entities in the same selection. Selecting a face will therefore deselect any selected brushes and entities and vice versa.</p>

		</div>
		<p>Selected objects are rendered with red edges and slightly tinted faces to distinguish them visually. The bounding box of the selected objects is rendered in red, with spikes extending from every corner. These spikes are useful to pecisely position objects in relation to other objects. If you hover the mouse cursor over a selection of objects, the spikes are rendered in a brighter color, and information about the bounds and position of the selected objects is displayed.</p>
		<a name="selecting_objects_in_the_3d_view"></a><h3>Selecting Objects in the 3D View</h3>
		<p>To select a single brush or entity, you simply <b>left click</b> on it in the 3D view. To select multiple objects, hold <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> while <b>left clicking</b>. If you click on a selected object while holding <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script>, it will be deselected. You can "paint select" multiple objects. First, select an object, then hold <script>print_key("Left-Click", "CmdCtrl");</script> while dragging over unselected objects. Take care not to begin your dragging over a selection of objects, as this will clone the selection.</p>
		<p>Faces can be selected by <b>left clicking</b> while holding <script>print_key("Shift");</script>. To select multiple faces, again hold <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script>. To select all faces of a brush, <b>left double click</b> the brush while holding <script>print_key("Shift");</script>. To add all faces of a brush to the current selection, additionally hold <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script>. You can also "paint select" multiple brush faces. To begin, select an inital face of a brush, then hold <script>print_key("Left-Click", "CmdCtrl");</script> while dragging over unselected faces.</p>
		<p>To deselect everything, simply <b>left click</b> into the void, or choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_select_none");</script> from the menu. To deselect faces indivdually, <script>print_key("Left-Click", "CmdCtrl", "Shift");</script> on each face to select or deselect it.</p>

		<a name="using_selection_brushes"></a><h3>Using Selection Brushes</h3>
		<p>If you need to select many entities and brushes which are close to each other, you can use selection brushes. A selection brush is an ordinary brush which was usually <a href="creating_new_objects.html">created</a> just for the purpose of selecting other objects. To use a selection brush, create (and select) a new brush that intersects or contains all of the objects that you would like to select. Then choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_select_touching");</script> and all objects which the selected brush touches are selected. Be aware that the previously selected brush is deleted by this operation.</p>
		<div class="images">

		</div>
		<p>Look at the above images for an example. Say you wish to select the two columns and the info_player_coop entity. For the sake of the example, you want to use a selection brush. So you quickly <a href="creating_new_objects.html#drawing_new_brushes_using_the_mouse">draw</a> a brush that touches only the columns and hit <script>print_key("T", "CmdCtrl");</script>. Voil&agrave; - the objects are selected.</p>
		<a name="other_selection_commands"></a><h3>Other Selection Commands</h3>
		<p>In the <b>Edit</b> menu, there are several other commands that help you to select objects. Choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_select_all");</script> to select every visible entity and brush in the map. If you want to select all brushes belonging to a particular brush entity, <script>print_key("Double Left-Click");</script> any brush in the entity. This selects all brushes of that brush entity. You can also select one brush which belongs to that entity and then choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_select_siblings"); </script></p>
		<p>You can also select objects by their line numbers in the map file they were loaded from. Choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_select_by_file_position");</script> and enter a comma- or space-separated list of line numbers into the dialog that pops up. Click <b>Ok</b> to select the objects.</p>
		<p>Finally, you can lock selected or unselected objects, so that they cannot be selected or modified. This can be useful when working with certain details. To begin, select some objects, and choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_lock_selected"); </script> to lock the selected objects, or <script>print_menu_command("edit_lock_unselected"); </script> to lock everything except the selected objects. Locked objects are rendered with a blue tint to indicate that they cannot be selected. To unlock objects, choose <script>print_menu_command("edit_unlock_all"); </script></p>
