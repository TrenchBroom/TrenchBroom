		<h2>Keeping an Overview</h2>
		<p>Sometimes, the 3D view can get cluttered in maps with a lot of detail or many entities. That's why there are several options to reduce the amount of objects in the 3D view. You can select between textured, flat and wirefame rendering, you can filter the 3D view so that only certain objects are rendered and you can isolate, hide or freeze the current selection.</p>

		<a name="render_modes"></a><h3>Render Modes</h3>
		<div class="images">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="render_mode_link" onclick="cycle_image_by_id('render_mode_img', render_modes);"><img id="render_mode_img" src="images/rendering_modes_textured.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="Render Modes"></a>
			<div class="imagecaption">Render modes (click to cycle through the modes)</div>
		</div>
		<p>You can choose from three render modes in TrenchBroom in the <b>View tab</b> of the inspector. The following modes are available:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Textured</b> - All faces are rendered with their textures.</li>
			<li><b>Flat</b> - All faces are rendered with the average color of the texture.</li>
			<li><b>Wireframe</b> - Faces are not rendered at all.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!-- <a name="view_management"></a><h2>View Management</h2> -->
		<a name="selection_hide"></a><h3>Selection Hiding</h3>
		<p>Sometimes it can be beneficial to hide objects that may be cluttering up the view. This can done with the <b>Hide Selection</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_hide_selected");</script>). To unhide objects, use the <b>Unhide All</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_unhide_all");</script>).</p>
		<div class="images">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="selection_hide_link" onclick="cycle_image_by_id('selection_hide_img', viewMgmt_hide);"><img id="selection_hide_img" src="images/view_management_normal.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="Selection Isolation"></a>
			<div class="imagecaption">Selection Hiding (click to see effects)</div>
		</div>

		<a name="selection_isolation"></a><h3>Selection Isolation</h3>
		<p>Very often, you'll want to isolate the selected objects to edit them with more ease in the 3D view. TrenchBroom provides this ability through the <b>Hide Unselected</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_hide_unselected");</script>). To unhide objects, use the <b>Unhide All</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_unhide_all");</script>).</p>
		<div class="images">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="selection_isolation_link" onclick="cycle_image_by_id('selection_isolation_img', viewMgmt_isolate);"><img id="selection_isolation_img" src="images/view_management_normal.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="Selection Isolation"></a>
			<div class="imagecaption">Selection Isolation (click to see effects)</div>
		</div>
		
		
		<a name="selection_lock"></a><h3>Locking the Selection</h3>
		<p>TrenchBroom provides the ability to lock the current selection in place, freezing it and making it safe from unintended edits. This is done with the <b>Lock Selected</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_lock_selected");</script>). To unlock objects, use the <b>Unlock All</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_unlock_all");</script>).</p>
		<div class="images">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="selection_lock_selected_link" onclick="cycle_image_by_id('selection_lock_img', viewMgmt_lock_selected);"><img id="selection_lock_img" src="images/view_management_normal.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="Selection Isolation"></a>
			<div class="imagecaption">Selection Locking (click to see effects)</div>
		</div>
		
		<a name="selection_lock_other"></a><h3>Locking Unselected Objects</h3>
		<p>You can also lock unselected objects, allowing you to edit the selection while being unable to edit anything else. This is done with the <b>Lock Unselected</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_lock_unselected");</script>). To unlock objects, use the <b>Unlock All</b> command (<script>print_menu_command("edit_unlock_all");</script>).</p>
		<div class="images">
			<a href="javascript:void(0)" id="selection_lock_unselected_link" onclick="cycle_image_by_id('unselection_lock_img', viewMgmt_lock_unselected);"><img id="unselection_lock_img" src="images/view_management_normal.jpg" width="600" height="397" alt="Selection Isolation"></a>
			<div class="imagecaption">Locking Unselected (click to see effects)</div>
		</div>
		
		<a name="render_filters"></a><h3>Render Filters</h3>
		<div class="images">
			<img src="images/render_filters.jpg" width="339" height="189" alt="Render Filters">
			<div class="imagecaption">Render Filters</div>
		</div>
		<p>You can select the types of objects which should be rendered in the 3D view by using the render filters in the <b>View tab</b> of the inspector. There are two categories with different checkboxes for each in the <b>Filter</b> section:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Entities</b> - Render entities in the 3D view.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Models - Render entity models in the 3D view.</li>
				<li>Bounds - Render entity bounding boxes in the 3D view.</li>
				<li>Classnames - Render entity classname labels in the 3D view.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><b>Brushes</b> - Render brushes in the 3D view.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Clip brushes - Render brushes entirely textured with the 'clip' texture.</li>
				<li>Skip brushes - Render brushes entirely textured with the 'skip' texture.</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Unchecking a checkbox will remove the appropriate type of object from the 3D view.</p>
		
		<h3>Filtering by name</h3>
		<p>Another way to filter what objects are rendered is by using the 'Show objects matching' text. Trenchbroom will display only those objects who's key names or key values match the entered text.</p>
		<p>For example, say you had two monster_shambler entities.  One of them had a 'targetname' key with the value 'scary' and the other had 'target' set to 'scary'.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the filter was set to "shambler", both monsters would be visible</li>
			<li>If the filter was set to "scary", both monsters would be visible</li>
			<li>If the filter was set to "targetname", only the first monster would be visible</li>
			<li>If the filter was set to "target", <b>both</b> monsters would be visible (because 'targetname' is a partial match)</li>
		</ul>

		<!--
		<a name="groups"></a><h3>Groups</h3>
		<p>Once your map reaches a certain size, it can be very useful to create brush groups. A brush group is a special brush entity that is ignored by the BSP compiler - its only use is to reduce clutter in the editor. In TrenchBroom, brush groups are listed in the <b>Map tab</b> of the inspector.</p>
		<p><img src="images/group_editor.jpg" width="300" height="176" alt="Group List" class="inline">To create a new brush group from the current selection, click on the <b>plus button</b> below the group list. To delete a brush group, select the group you want to delete in the group list and click on the <b>minus button</b>.</p>
		<p>To activate one or more brush groups, check them in the group list. If any brush group is active, only the brushes belonging to this group are rendered in the 3D view.</p>
		<br clear="all">
		<p>Newly created brushes are added to the selected brush group if any of them is activated. If no brush group is activated, newly created brushes are not added to any group. If no brush group is selected, but at least one is activated, the newly created brushes are added to the activated brush group which was created last. Note that entities cannot be added to groups, so they are always rendered regardless.</p>
