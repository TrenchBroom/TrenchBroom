		<h2>The Face Inspector</h2>
		<p>This is where all texture information is displayed.  Here, you can select which texture to apply to the selection as well as the texture's offsets, rotation and scaling.</p>
		<div style="clear:left;">
			<a id="face_inspector_alignment"></a><h3>Texture Alignment Section</h3>
			<p>This part of the Face Inspector is where texture alignment is handled. On the left is a large preview of the texture and on the right you can modify the offset, scale and rotation of the current selection (see <a href="selecting_objects.html#selecting_objects_in_the_3d_view">this section on face selection</a> for how to control this).  You can enter values directly, or you can use the spinner controls to increment/decrement the values.  The intervals of these spinners have default values but change based on conditions.</p>
			<div class="images">

				<div class="imagecaption">Texture alignment controls in the face inspector.</div>
			</div>
			<ul style="clear:left;">
				<li>For texture <b>offsets</b>, clicking the spinner buttons will offset the texture by the current grid size.  Pressing <script>print_key("Shift");</script> while clicking the spinner will offset the texture by 2X the grid size.  Pressing <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> while clicking the spinner will always offset the texture by 1 unit.</li>
				<li>For texture <b>scaling</b>, pressing the spinner buttons will scale the texture in increments of 0.1.  <script>print_key("Shift");</script> increases this to 0.25 and <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> reduces this to 0.01.</li>
				<li>For texture <b>rotation</b>, the default value of angle changes is 15&#176;.  Pressing <script>print_key("Shift");</script> increases this value to 90&#176;. <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> reduces this value to 1&#176; increments.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The final control in this section is the <b>Reset</b> button.  This buttons resets all offset, rotation and scale settings on the current selection to the default values of '0, 0' for offsets, '0' for rotation and '1, 1' for scale.  This is useful when you want to get your brush's textures back to default values after performing operations on it with texture lock enabled.  It does <b>not</b> modify the textures applied to the selections, so you can use this button on selections that contain multiple different textures.</p>
			<p>All of the previously documented controls work either in face selection mode, or brush selection mode.  When modifying textures in brush selection mode, this is the only way of doing so.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="clear:left;">
			<a id="textures_texture_browser"></a><h3>Texture Browser</h3>
			<p>This is where textures from all the WAD files currently in use are displayed.</p>
			<div class="images">
				<img src="images/face_tab_bottom.jpg" width="352" alt="Face Inspector, Texture Browser" />
				<div class="imagecaption">Texture browser.</div>
			</div>
			<p>At the very top of this section are options that control how the textures are displayed in the browser.</p>
			<p>The first control on the left is a drop down list that allows you to sort textures either by <b>Name</b> or by <b>Usage</b>. Sorting by Name is fairly simple, it sorts the textures alphabetically.  Sorting by <b>Usage</b> is a little more interesting and sorts textures based on how often they are used in the map.  A common wall texture therefore appears first in the list while the more rarely used textures appear near the bottom (and unused textures are last).  This is extremely useful at the beginning of a map where you will need the entire wad open, and are still in the process of assembling your 'palette' of textures.</p>
			<p>The next control, <b>Group</b>, is a toggle button.  It changes the texture browser to display textures grouped together based on what WAD file they belong to (the wad files are sorted based on the order they are loaded).</p>
			<p>The third control, <b>Used</b>, is another toggle button.  When enabled, this filters out textures that are not used in the map.  This is very useful when you are satisfied with the current texture palette and no longer need to add new ones into the mix.  This ensures only textures already in the map are available for selection.</p>
			<p>The final control is a search box that dynamically filters textures based on their name.  If you are looking for liquids, typing "*" will show only textures who's names start with the "*" character, for example: "*water1, *water2, *lava".  You could also filter with "wat" which would return only "*water1, *water2".  The little X button on the right will clear the currently typed filter.</p>

			<a id="textures_keyboard_shortcuts"></a><h2>Keyboard Texture Application Shortcuts</h2>
			<p>Keyboard shortcuts exist for texture offset and rotation and greatly speed up texture alignment.  With practice, you may never need to use the textbox controls and will do all of your texture alignment purely in the 3D Viewport.  Of note:  These shortcuts are <b>ONLY</b> available in face selection mode.  Attempting to use these shortcuts when in brush selection mode will result in brush translation and brush rotation operations instead!</p>
			<h3>Texture Offset</h3>
			<p>You can offset textures up, down, left and right with the arrow keys <script>print_key("ArrowKeys");</script>.</p>
			<p>As with the spinner controls detailed previously, the offset is based on the current grid size and modifier keys can be used to increase or decrease the offset amount.  <script>print_key("ArrowKeys", "Shift");</script> offsets textures by twice the current grid size and <script>print_key("ArrowKeys", "CmdCtrl");</script> offsets textures by 1 unit.</p>
			<div class="images">
				<img src="images/texture_alignment_shortcuts.jpg" width="352" alt="Face Inspector, Texture Alignment" />
				<div class="imagecaption">Texture alignment shortcuts.</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Relative Offsets</h3>
			<p>Unlike other editors, when using keyboard shortcuts texture offsets are applied <b>relative</b> to the camera.  The example image to the left shows what this means: because of the placement and viewing angle of the camera, pressing the <script>print_key("Up", "CmdCtrl");</script> key would actually cause the X alignment offset to increase by 1 whereas in other editors, this would cause the Y alignment offset to decrease by 1.</p>
			<p>What this means is that texture alignment in Trenchbroom is intuitive and reactive to what you are looking at.  You do not need to guess what texture axis is what, only to press the key that would move the texture in the direction that you would like it to move.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="clear:left;">
			<h3>Texture Rotation</h3>
			<p>For rotating textures, the <script>print_key("PgUp");</script> and <script>print_key("PgDown");</script> keys rotate the texture clockwise and counter-clockwise at 15&#176; intervals. As with the keyboard commands for moving textures detailed previously, the <script>print_key("CmdCtrl");</script> modifier key decreases the rotation angle to 1&#176;.</p>

			<a id="textures_mouse_shortcuts"></a><h2>Mouse Texture Application Shortcuts</h2>
			<p>Trenchbroom has the ability to quickly paste a texture onto other faces.  This is accomplished by first choosing a face with the texture you want by <script>print_key("Left-Clicking", "Shift");</script> on it.  Now, by <script>print_key("Left-Clicking", "Alt");</script> on other faces, you can quickly apply the same texture to multiple faces without needing to first select the faces.  If you want to apply this texture to the entire brush, simply <script>print_key("Double Left-Click", "Alt");</script> on any face of that brush. Note: Can only be done when a single face is selected.</p>
