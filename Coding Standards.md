# Naming
- Use camel case for class names: `MyUsefulClass`
- Functions, methods, variables and parameters use camel case and begin with a lowercase character:
  `void myUsefulFunction(const int aHelpfulParameter);`
- Private fields are prefixed with `m_`
- Constants use camel case and begin with an uppercase character:
  `static const int ThisIsAConstant = 1;`

# Formatting
- Indent with 4 spaces, no tabs
- No extra lines for opening braces:
  ```
  namespace … {
  class … {
  if (…) {
  …
  ```
- Use braces for 1-statement if / else blocks:
  ```
  if (…) {
      doThis();
  } else {
      doThat();
  }
   ```
- No inline if statements such as `if (…) doThis();`
- Avoid header files that declare more than one class
- Class members are usually ordered as follows, but it is ok to deviate from this if there is a good reason.
  1. Type aliases and static const members.
  2. Member variables
  3. Constructors / destructors
  4. Operators
  5. Public member functions
  6. Protected member functions
  7. Private member functions
  8. Extension interface (private pure virtual member functions)

# Types
- Only use `auto` when the type is obvious from surrounding visible code, e.g.:
  ```
  std::vector<Assets::Texture*> textures;
  …
  for (auto* texture : textures) {
      …
  ```
  
  Also OK: `auto textureCount = static_cast<int>(textures.size());`
- Don't do:  `auto mods = document->mods();`
  
  Instead, do: `StringList mods = document->mods();`
- The codebase often uses aliases for templates, vectors and smart pointers, e.g.:
  
  ```
  using vec3d = vec<double,3>;
  using MyClassList = std::vector<MyClass>;
  using MyClassPtr = std::shared_ptr<MyClass>;
  using String = std::string;
  ```
  
  Use these where they already exist, but for new code,
  use `std::vector<MyNewClass>` and `std::shared_ptr<MyNewClass>` directly,
  and only create aliases for verbose or deeply nested types. e.g.:
  
  ```
  using IntToListOfStringPairs = std::map<int, std::vector<std::pair<String, String>>>;
  ```

# Misc
- Unused function parameters should be commented out, e.g.:

  ```
  void myFunction(const int index, const int /* unusedParameter */) {...}
  ```
  
  Alternatively, it is allowed to mark them as unused in the function body if commenting them out is not
  possible. 'Macros.h' contains a macro that can be used here:
   
  ```
  #include "Macros.h"
  
  void myFunction(const int index, const int unusedParameter = 0) {
      unused(unusedParameter);
  }
  ```
  
  If the semantics of the parameter is clear from the type alone, then it is also allowed to delete
  the parameter name:

  ```
  void myOtherFunction(const int index, const Model::World*) {...}
  ```
  
  In certain cases, it is more useful to use the `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute, esp. when the function
  body contains conditionally compiled code.
  
  In general, it is preferable to not delete the parameter name and it should be done with care.

# Compilation Times

This section presents some guidelines to keep compilation times low.

## Avoid Including Headers

Avoid including headers in other headers. Remember that including a header B in another header A includes B in every
file that includes A, and so on.
- Use forward declarations wherever possible. Remember that you can forward declare classes, class templates, and
  scoped enums. Furthermore, type aliases and even template aliases can use forward declarations.
- If you need to refer to a type in a header file, you should use a forward declaration except for the following reasons:
  1. It's a typed defined in namespace `std`.
  2. The type is used as a by value member of a class that you are declaring in your header.
  3. The type is used in the implementation of a template function.
  - Note that you should also use forward declarations for types used in the following contexts:
    - By value function parameters or return types - it is ok to use a fwd declaration, the type need only be fully
      defined the call site, where it can be included.
    - Type parameters for standard library containers - if you are declaring a member of type `std::vector<Foo>` in a
      class, you need not include `Foo` in the header file where your class is declared. You may have to declare a
      destructor which you must implement in the corresponding cpp file, where `Foo` must be fully defined. Defaulting
      the constructor in the cpp file is sufficient.
- Split off a part of a header into a separate header, e.g. declare some functions separately if they must include
  large headers. See the next item for examples involving std library headers.

Avoid including std library headers. Since names in std cannot be forward declared, this is sometimes unavoidable,
but there are some ways to mitigate the effects.
- Split off parts of a header into a separate header. Consider the following header `X.h`:
  ```
  #include <ostream>
  
  class X { ... }
  
  std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& s, const X& x) { ... }
  ```
  The stream insertion operator requires that `<ostream>` be included in `X.h`, with the effect that `<ostream>` is
  included wherever `X.h` is included, even if the stream insertion operator is not used in that place. In this case,
  it is useful to split off a header `X_IO.h` that declares the stream insertion operator while removing the 
  `<ostream>` include and the operator declaration from `X.h`.

  As an alternative when using the std library iostreams, you can include `<iosfwd>` in the header file. `<iosfwd>` has
  forward declarations for all iostream related types, so it can be used when stream operators are only declared and not
  implemented in your header file.

- Use a function template to avoid specifying the std library type directly. Consider the following example: 

  ```
  #include <set>
  
  class X {
      ...
  
      void doIt(const std::set& s); 
   }
  ```

  Here, the same problem arises: `<set>` is included everywhere where `X.h` is included. Since the member function
  declaration for `X::doIt` cannot easily be moved to another header, we might consider turning it into a function
  template:

  ```
  class X {
      ...
  
      template <typename S>
      void doIt(const S& s) { ... } 
   }
  ```

  Now, `<set>` must only be included at the call sites of `X::doIt`, which are often `cpp` files where includes do not
  propagate.

# Preinstantiated Templates
In certain cases involving templates, it might be useful to explicitly instantiate them if the template arguments are
known, if there is a small set of combinations of template arguments in use and if the function templates and class
template member functions need not be inlined by the compiler. Consider this example:

```
template <typename T, std::size_t S>
class vec<T,S> {...}
```

Assume that we are only ever using `vec<float,3>` and `vec<double,3>`. Then we can avoid instantiating the member
functions of these templates at every use site by preinstantiating the class templates. This requires creating a 
header file `vec_instantiation.h` and `vec_instantiation.cpp` with the following contents:

```
// vec_instantiation.h
#include "vec.h"
extern template class vec<float,3>;
extern template class vec<double,3>;
```

```
// vec_instantiation.cpp
#include "vec.h"
template class vec<float,3>;
template class vec<double,3>;
```

The compiler will still instantiate the class template `vec` wherever it is used, but depending on whether or not
its member functions are implemented inline, it will not instantiate the functions bodies. Specifically, if a
member function is implemented inline in the class template `vec`, then its function body will be instantiated by the
compiler to facilitate inlining. If the function body is implemented out of line, the compiler will not instantiate
it, but it will also not be able to inline it at the call site.

Therefore, using preinstiated templates requires careful consideration of performance, as it precludes function body
inlining by the compiler.

# Features
- We use C++17.
- The entire source code and test cases must compile without warnings.
- Everything that can be const should be const: methods, parameters and variables.
- Move semantics should be used when it makes sense from a performance perspective. Generally, parameters should be
  taken by const reference, const pointer or by value rather than by rvalue reference or forwarding reference.
- Use RAII where possible.
- Avoid raw pointers unless they are confined to a method, class, or subsystem.
  Don't return raw pointers from public methods. Favor references and smart
  pointers over raw pointers.
