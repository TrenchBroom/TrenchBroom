 * An abstract line is a generalization of lines in space. Thereby, a line can be bounded
 * or unbounded in either direction. The following concepts arise:
 *
 * - If the line is unbounded in both directions, it is just that, a line.
 * - If the line is bounded in one direction, it is a ray.
 * - If the line is bounded in both directions, it is a segment.
 *
 * In any case, the concept of an abstract line requires that the concrete line type has
 * the following members:
 *
 * - Line::component_type, the component type of the origin and direction
 * - Line::size, the number of dimensions
 * - vec<component_type, size> Line::get_origin() const, returns the line's origin
 * - vec<component_type, size> Line::get_direction() const, returns the line's direction
 *
 * The functions in this file operate on this concept.
