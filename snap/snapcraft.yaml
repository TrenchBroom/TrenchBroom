  To enable Quake engines within the editor install and connect an engine:

  ```
    # Quake 1 support
    snap install quakespasm-beidl # or vkquake
    snap connect trenchbroom:quake-engine quakespasm-beidl:quake-engine
  ```

  ```
    # Quake 2 support
    snap install yamagi-quake2-beidl
    snap connect trenchbroom:quake2-engine yamagi-quake2-beidl:quake2-engine
  ```

  The engine will be available at one of these locations:
    - `/snap/trenchbroom/current/quake-engine/`
    - `/snap/trenchbroom/current/quake2-engine/`
  Or:
    - `/var/lib/snapd/snap/trenchbroom/current/quake-engine/`
    - `/var/lib/snapd/snap/trenchbroom/current/quake2-engine/`
