/*QUAKED _decal (0 1.0 0) ?
-------- KEYS --------
target : The name of the entity targeted for projection.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader with "polygonoffset" (or other blending methods) or z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.

/*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4)
-------- KEYS --------
angle : Rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
angles : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
_scale : Scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

/*QUAKED ammo_bfg (.3 .3 1) (-16 -16 -16) (16 16 16) SUSPENDED
{ model("models/powerups/ammo/bfgam.md3"); }
BFG ammo. Gives the player 15 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : Time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : Random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see notes).
count : Sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 15).
team : Set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see notes).
target : Picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : A target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
targetShaderName : Points to the name of the original shader to swap out for triggerable shader entities (see notes).
targetShaderNewName : Points to the name of the new shader to swap in for triggerable shader entities (see notes).
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
notbot : Used to make an item invisible for bot attraction.
gametype : Used to set item to spawn in only selected gametype(s). Requires Q3A 1.32 point release.
	ffa : Free for All
	tournament : Tournament
	single : Single Player

	oneflag : One Flag CTF (Team Arena)
	obelisk : Overload (Team Arena)
	harvester : Harvester (Team Arena)
	teamtournament : Team Tournament (Team Arena)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : Item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the targetShaderName value, will be changed to the targetShaderNewName value. For example, turning a light on:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

/*QUAKED func_bobbing (0 .5 .8) ? X_AXIS Y_AXIS
Solid entity that oscillates back and forth in a linear motion. By default, it will have an amount of displacement in either direction equal to the dimension of the brush in the axis in which it's bobbing. Entity bobs on the Z axis (up-down) by default. It can also emit sound if the "noise" key is set. Will crush the player when blocked.
-------- KEYS --------
speed : Amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle (default 4).
height : Sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32).
phase : Sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : Path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (e.g. sound/world/drone6.wav - see notes).
model2 : Path/name of model to include (.md3 files only, e.g. models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : Alternate method of setting XYZ origin of sound and .md3 model included with entity (see notes).
light : ConstantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : ConstantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).
notfree : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : When set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
targetname : Used to attach a misc_model entity to this entity.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs OR _receiveshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
X_AXIS : Entity will bob along the X axis.
Y_AXIS : Entity will bob along the Y axis.
-------- NOTES --------
In order for the sound to be emitted from the entity, it is recommended to include a brush with an origin shader at its center, otherwise the sound will not follow the entity as it moves. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the targetShaderName value, will be changed to the targetShaderNewName value. For example, turning a light on:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

/*QUAKED func_pendulum (0 .5 .8) ?
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity. Blocking the pendulum instantly kills a player.
-------- KEYS --------

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : Determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : Lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height : If set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : Damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : If set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.

-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in this entity (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs OR _receiveshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- NOTES --------
1. Trains always start on in the game.
2. Trains do not damage the played when blocked.
3. Trains cannot emit sound.
4. Trains are not triggerable or toggle-able.
5. Trains cannot be block-stopped just by getting in their way, the player must be wedged between the train and another obstacle to block it.

Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the targetShaderName value, will be changed to the targetShaderNewName value. For example, turning a light on:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

And this would turn it back off:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

_remap : Used to remap textures/shaders in the model. To remap all shaders to a given shader, use "*;models/mymodel/mytexture". To remap a specific shader, use "models/mymodel/old;models/mymodel/new". To remap additional shaders, use _remap2, _remap3, etc.
target : Used to attach the misc_model to a brush entity, where its "targetname" key is the same value.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on this model (if model is using lightmapped shaders) (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs OR _receiveshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.

/*QUAKED misc_portal_camera (1 .5 .25) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SLOWROTATE FASTROTATE NOWOBBLE
Portal camera. This camera is used to project its view onto a portal surface in the level through the intermediary of a misc_portal_surface entity. Use the "angles" key or target a target_position or info_notnull entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
-------- KEYS --------
angles: This sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of the portal camera (default 0 0). Use "roll" key to set roll angle.
target : Point this to a target_position entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
targetname : A misc_portal_surface portal surface indicator must point to this.
roll : Roll angle of camera. A value of 0 is upside down and 180 is the same as the player's view.

/*QUAKED target_speaker (0 .7 .7) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) LOOPED_ON LOOPED_OFF GLOBAL ACTIVATOR
Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : Path/name of .wav file to play (e.g. sound/world/growl1.wav - see notes).
wait : Delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see notes).
random : Random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see notes).

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : Sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : Sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : Sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : Sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the targetShaderName value, will be changed to the targetShaderNewName value. For example, turning a light on:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
"targetShaderName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
"targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world.
-------- KEYS --------
message : Text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : Path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (e.g. music/sonic5.wav).
_ambient OR ambient : Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient light color (default 0 0 0).
gravity : Gravity of level (default 800 = normal gravity).
gridsize : Granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : Q3Map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density (default 1024 1024 0, 0 values = disable). 
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_minlight : Minimum light value, levelwide. Uses the _color key to set color. Does not add, unlike ambient.
_minvertexlight : Minimum vertex lighting, levelwide.
_mingridlight : Minimum lightgrid (dynamic entity lighting) levelwide.
_keeplights : Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase.
_noshadersun : Ignore q3map_sun/sun directives in sky shaders and ONLY use entity sun lights.
_farplanedist : Limit on how many units the vis phase of compilation can see. Used in combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce r_speeds on large, open maps.
_foghull : Shader to use for "fog hull". Foghull shader should be a sky shader. Omit the "textures/" prefix.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scales the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in the world. Can be overridden in func_group (or other entities) (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs OR _receiveshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix. Overridable in entities.
_styleNalphaGen : *IMPORTANT* Replace "N" in the key "_styleNalphaGen" with an integer between 1 and 31 as your style index. Values takes standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5)
_styleNrgbGen : *IMPORTANT* Replace "N" in the key "_styleNrgbGen" with an integer between 1 and 31 as your style index. Values take standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5)
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value denotes number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
