 Q3MAP2 ENTITIES

=============================================================================
-->

<group name="_decal" color="0 1.0 0">
-------- KEYS --------
<target key="target" name="Target">The name of the entity targeted for projection.</target>
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader with "polygonoffset" (or other blending methods) or z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.
</group>

<point name="_skybox" color="0.77 0.88 1.0" box="-4 -4 -4 4 4 4">
-------- KEYS --------
<angle key="angle" name="Yaw Angle">Rotation angle of the sky surfaces.</angle>
<angles key="angles" name="Pitch Yaw Roll">Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).</angles>
<real key="_scale" name="Scale" value="64">Scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.</real>
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

<point name="ammo_bfg" color=".3 .3 1" box="-16 -16 -16 16 16 16" model="models/powerups/ammo/bfgam.md3">
BFG ammo. Gives the player 15 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
<real key="wait" name="Respawn Delay" value="40">Time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).</real>
<real key="random" name="Respawn Delay Variance" value="0">Random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see notes).</real>
<integer key="count" name="Ammo Given" value="15">Sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 15).</integer>

<texture key="targetShaderNewName" name="Target Shader New Name">Name of the new shader to remap by (see notes).</texture>
<boolean key="notfree" name="Hidden For FFA">When set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.</boolean>

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
<flag key="SUSPENDED" name="No Drop To Floor" bit="0">Item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.</flag>
-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

Unlike in Quake 2, doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team name to all of them. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush.

Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname"). Note: func_door and func_plat targeted by a misc_model will also require a trigger_* entity with the same target key/value as the model.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

The item_botroam entity can be used when a bot does not roam the whole level or prefers to go to only specific areas. This (invisible) item can be placed in a map just like regular items. Nobody can actually pick up the item it's only used to attract bots to certain places of the map. The value is the weight of the roam_item is relative to the weight assigned other items in the map (each bot has its own weights). The bot character specific item weights are stored with the bot characters AI files ("botname"_i.c for items and "botname"_w.c for weapons) in the botfiles/bots/ sub-folder in the .pk3 file.

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

a) Automatically give items to players when they spawn in the game: Make a spawn location entity like info_player_deathmatch or CTF respawn, targeting this entity, then target it to the item(s) to give to the player upon respawn.
b) Give items to players during the game: Make a trigger_multiple/func_button/other_activatable_entity target this entity, then make it target the item(s) to give to the player when the trigger is touched.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:

-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

<group name="worldspawn" color="0 0 0">
Entity, which stores regular static map primitives (brushes and patches).
-------- KEYS --------
<string key="message" name="Logon Message">Text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.</string>
<sound key="music" name="Music File">Path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (e.g. music/sonic5.wav).</sound>
<real key="gravity" name="Gravity" value="800">Gravity of level (default normal gravity: 800).</real>
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
<integer key="gridsize" name="Dynamic Light Granularity" value="64 64 128">Granularity of the lightgrid, created by q3map, which is used to dynamically light certain game objects, like players and items. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 64 64 128. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.</integer>
<integer key="_blocksize" name="BSP Block Size" value="1024 1024 1024">Map compiler splits the BSP tree along axial planes (X, Y and Z) for optimization. It does it as often, as specified in _blocksize key for respective axis (in units) (default 1024 1024 1024, 0 = disable, setting single value 'N' equals to setting 'N N N'). I.e. lower values result in more splits and vice versa. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density. Maps, having flat architecture, might work better with horizontal splits disabled ('N N 0').</integer>
<real key="_ambient" name="Ambient Intensity" value="0">Adds a constant value to overall lighting (default 0, range 0 - 255). Only recommended use is small values for cosmetic purposes, as high values will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.</real>
<color key="_color" name="Ambient Color" value="1 1 1">RGB color value for ambient and other global light parameters (default is 1 1 1).</color>
<real key="_minlight" name="Min Lightmap Intensity" value="0">Minimum light value, levelwide. Uses the _color key to set color. Since it does not add unlike ambient, but overrides existing light values, affected areas will get flat constant light. Therefore use is highly not recommended!</real>
<real key="_minvertexlight" name="Min Vertex Intensity" value="0">Minimum vertex lighting, levelwide.</real>
<real key="_mingridlight" name="Min Dynamic Intensity" value="0">Minimum lightgrid (dynamic entity lighting) levelwide.</real>
<boolean key="_keeplights" name="Keep Light Entities">Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase.</boolean>
<boolean key="_noshadersun" name="Ignore Shader Sun">Ignore q3map_sun/sun directives in sky shaders and ONLY use entity sun lights.</boolean>
<real key="_farplanedist" name="Far Clip Distance">Limit on how many units the vis phase of compilation can see. Used in combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce r_speeds on large, open maps.</real>
<texture key="_foghull" name="Fog Hull Shader">Shader to use for "fog hull". Foghull shader should be a sky shader. Omit the "textures/" prefix.</texture>
<real key="_lightmapscale" name="Lightmap Scale" value="1">Floating point value, scaling the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in the world. Can be overridden in func_group (or other entities) (default 1.0).</real>
<integer key="_castshadows" name="Shadow Caster Level" value="1">Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. &gt; 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.</integer>
<integer key="_receiveshadows" name="Shadow Receiver Level" value="1">Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. &gt; 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. &lt; 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.</integer>
<texture key="_celshader" name="Cel Shader">Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.</texture> Overridable in entities.
<string key="_styleNalphaGen" name="Style Light alphaGen">*IMPORTANT* Replace "N" in the key "_styleNalphaGen" with an integer between 1 and 31 as your style index. Values takes standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5)</string>
<string key="_styleNrgbGen" name="Style Light rgbGen">*IMPORTANT* Replace "N" in the key "_styleNrgbGen" with an integer between 1 and 31 as your style index. Values take standard shader waveform functions (e.g. wave sin 0.5 0.3 0.25 1.5)</string>
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
<texture key="_indexmap" name="Terrain Blending Map">Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.</texture>
<integer key="_layers" name="Terrain Layers">Number of unique root shaders that will be used on the terrain.</integer>
<texture key="_shader" name="Terrain MetaShader">Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.</texture>
