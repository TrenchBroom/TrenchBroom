DEFINES:......................................................................
 COUNT:		Number of particles to spray(1 is normal for streams of particles)..(int) !> 10

 VELOCITY:		How fast the particles move..............(float)
 EMISSION:		Emission rate on a per frame basis.......(int) !<1 anything <1 will = 1
 EMISSIONTIME:	Active only if Toggle Emmision flag is set.  Amount of frames particle Emission occurs.(int)
 SCALE:		The size of the particles................(float) !< 0.01f !>200.0f
 DELTA_ALPHA:	The decay rate of the particle's life time.  The smaller the value(i.e. 0.10) the longer the life)(float)
 ALPHA_LEVEL:	The initial state of the Alpha level.....(float)
 TARGET:		Name of target to project towards with initial velocity..(chars)
 GRAVITY:		How much gravity to apply to particles. The value is rate of acceleration. This is scalar. Default is none.(float)
 GRAVITYDIR:	Name of target that gravity will be applied towards.(chars) Gets turned into normalized vector. Default is down.
 TARGETNAME:	Name of particle stream.  Can be used if targeted from other objects.
 STOPTIME:		Time for the SFX Particle generator to spit out particles before it completely shuts down.  It will not generate particles until triggered again.
 RADIUS:		Radius spread for spawning particles.  If you are not targeted then you will not get a clean cylindrical shape.
 RADIUS Notes:	Suggested use would be a targeted complex particle with, say, more than 3 particles being spawned at once.
 To get a clean cylinder make sure your spread is a very low value(i.e. 0 -5). If you emit more than 8 particles make SURE your emission time is higher than 3 if your delta_alpha is a low value.
 The color is set by the standard color selection window(hit k when entity is highlighted)
FLAGS:.......................................................................
 P_<Name>:		The type of particle to use. The last particle selection will be the one used.
 Toggle Emit:	This will toggle the particle stream off for 'Emission' number of frames.  This will also maintain the particle stream for 'EMISSIONTIME' number of frames.
 Random Emit:	Used in conjunction with Toggle Emission only, this will randomize the 'Emission' value, but does assure to hold off for at least 1/4th 'Emission'.
 Start Off:	This will start the particle generator in an off state and will not start until triggered.
