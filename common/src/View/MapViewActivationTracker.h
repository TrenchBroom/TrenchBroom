         * make the group active again.

         * a hand icon to indicate that the user must click on one of the views before it is ready for interaction.
         *
         * The map views change into the active state when the user clicks on any of the map views with the left mouse button.

         * loses its activation state.

         * When the map views are in the active state, the focus will follow the mouse cursor, that is, when the user moves
         * the mouse cursor from one map view to another, then that map view will receive focus.
