         * This template is used to match the faces of two polyhedra. The two polyhedra are expected to have the majority of
         * their vertices in common as a result of a vertex move / addition / removal operation.
         *
         * Two faces match if they have identical vertex positions or if they have an optimal matching score. The matching
         * score is based on a relation over the vertices of the left and the vertices of the right polyhedron. The score of two
         * faces is then the sum of all pairs of related vertices (l,r), where l is a vertex of the left face L, and r is
         * a vertex of the right face R. Two vertices (l,r) are related if any of the following conditions apply:
         *
         * 1. l and r have identical positions
         * 2. There is no vertex in the right polyhedron that corresponds to l, but there is a vertex l' in the left polyhedron
         *    such that (l',r) are related, and l and l' are adjacent in the left polyhedron.
         * 3. There is no vertex in the left polyhedron that corresponds to r, but there is a vertex r' in the right polyhedron
         *    such that (l,r') are related, and r and r' are adjacent in the right polyhedron.
         *
         * Case 2. corresponds to a vertex removal, that is, a vertex was removed from the left polyhedron. Case 3. corresponds
         * to a vertex addition, that is, a vertex was added to the right polyhedron. If a vertex is moved, both cases apply
         * since the move can be regarded as a vertex removal and a subsequent addition.
         *
         * Using this relation over the vertices, the matcher will find the best matching face from the left polyhedron for
         * each face of the right polyhedron. If multiple faces of the left polyhedron have a maximal matching score, the
         * matcher selects a face such that its normal is closest to the normal of the right face.
